[2026-02-07 13:35:00] Story: US-001 - Fix CSS 404 for ultimate_turbo_modal_bootstrap.css
Implemented: Removed .css extension from @import directive in application.scss
Files: app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
Tests: PASSING (617 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors)
Learnings for future iterations:
- Propshaft SCSS: @import "file.css" generates a CSS @import url() request (causes 404). Remove the .css extension to embed file contents inline.
- This is a one-line fix with high impact — eliminates persistent console 404 error.

[2026-02-07 14:57:00] Story: US-002 - Fix Bootstrap ScrollSpy import in revenue controller
Implemented: Added explicit Bootstrap ESM import in the revenue Stimulus controller so bootstrap.ScrollSpy resolves in module scope.
Files: app/javascript/controllers/oroshi/orders/revenue_controller.js, .milhouse/prd.json
Tests: PASSING (617 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors)
Learnings for future iterations:
- Stimulus controllers cannot rely on Bootstrap imported in application.js; each controller using bootstrap.* must import bootstrap directly.
- The existing ScrollSpy initialization logic worked once bootstrap was in scope; this story required a minimal targeted JS change.
