Quality: rubocop 398 files, 0 offenses | tests 617 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors
Learnings for future iterations:
- All work was completed across prior agent iterations; this iteration verified and closed the PRD
- The prd.json was not updated to passes:true in prior iterations - always update prd.json immediately after committing
- Always run full test suite (bin/rails test) before marking stories complete - sandbox E2E test takes ~114s but catches integration issues
