          <b>Buyer Description</b>:<br>
          <br>
          All orders require a buyer.<br>
          <br>
          Buyer handles are used for template view input and are
          selected on the order entry page to save space and make
          the interface easier to use.<br>
          <br>
          Buyer type changes the available inputs for orders and
          is also useful for searching orders.<br>
          <br>
          Buyer associated system ID is optional but is also the
          default way to sort buyers.<br>
          <br>
          Buyer addresses are displayed on invoices unless left blank.<br>
          <br>
          Buyer categories are not required but are used to
          categorize buyers when searching orders and entering
          payment receipt data.<br>
          <br>
          The three types of costs are required but can be set to 0.
          <br>
          Buyers cannot be deleted because all orders registered
          to that buyer would become orphaned.
          To disable a buyer, simply toggle the display switch.<br>

          <b>Supplier Description</b>:<br>
          All supplies must be supplied from a valid supplier under a valid supply organization.<br>
          <br>
          To enter supplies, users must first select a supply reception time
          associated with the supply organization.
          A list of suppliers and supply type variations that must be
          selected will be displayed in this panel.
          Supplies are displayed in supplier number order.<br>
          <br>
          The invoice name is used in official documents such as
          payment invoices. Within the app, the company name is used
          to identify suppliers. The short name (for checklist) is used
          in supply checklists printed before reception for quality control.<br>
          <br>
          When you select a date on the Raw Materials Supply tab and
          click the Create Statement button, a modal will open and
          a preview invoice will be created.<br>
          <br>
          Suppliers cannot be deleted because all supplies registered
          to that supplier would become orphaned.
          To disable a supplier, simply toggle the display switch.<br>

        suppliers_organizations: |
          <b>Supply Organizations & Suppliers Description</b>:<br>
          All supplies require a valid supplier, and all suppliers
          require a valid supply organization, as well as valid
          supply types and supply type variations.
          Payment invoices are issued from suppliers to supplier organizations.
          Therefore, data such as the supplier organization's tax code
          and address are used in invoice documents.
        suppliers_organizations_edit: |
          <b>Supply Organization Description</b>:<br>
          The data for "supply organization" here is primarily used
          to fill in information for payment invoice documents.
          The registered email will be sent with scheduled documents attached.<br>

        supply_reception_times: |
          <b>Supply Reception Time Description</b>:<br>
          Supply organizations without reception times cannot register supplies.<br>
          <br>
          All registered supplies must include a supply time used to
          create data entry pages for the combination of valid supply
          type variations within supply types, valid suppliers within
          supply organizations, and variables, such as distributing
          payment invoices and statements to suppliers.<br>
          <br>
          Supply reception times cannot be deleted if they have been
          used in the past because supplies that used this supply
          reception time would no longer have an associated supply time.
          To disable these, simply deselect all supplier organizations.<br>
          <br>
          If you believe this is an exceptional situation,
          please contact your system administrator.
        supply_types: |
          <b>Supply Types & Variations Description</b>:<br>
          Supply items are associated with suppliers and are displayed
          on the Raw Materials Supply page when a date and supply
          reception time are selected.
          Supply types are sorted by supply type on the supply input page.<br>
          <br>
          The unit setting determines the price and input method for
          a given supply. For example, raw materials (weight managed)
          are usually displayed in "kg" units, and raw materials
          (count managed) are usually displayed in "item" units.<br>
          <br>
          The "liquid" setting is related to supply check documents
          for quality control created before supplies arrive at the factory.
          If an item is set to "liquid", pH, temperature, and
          salinity fields become active.
        supply_types_selection: |
          <b>Supply Type Selection Description</b>:<br>

          you may need to refresh the page depending on the situation
          for it to appear in this list.<br>
          <br>
          Supply types cannot be deleted because all supplies registered
          to that supply type would become orphaned.
          To disable a supply type, simply toggle the display switch.<br>
          <br>
          If you believe this is an exceptional situation,
          please contact your system administrator.
        supply_type_variation_edit: |
          "Variation name" is used in official documents,
          and "handle" is used in the app and quality control
          supply check documents. The input count in supply form is
          the number of input boxes displayed on the supply input page.
          For example, for small-batch raw materials, suppliers usually
          only provide one bucket.
        materials: |
          <b>View and edit product and manufacturing materials information.</b><br>
          <br>
          Shipping receptacles are selected for each order, but defaults
          are set in product variations and can be set when creating
          order templates.<br>
          <br>
          Manufacturing materials only apply to products, not their
          product variations, so they must be materials that apply to
          all sub-products. They can be set to apply to products
          by item, by box, by freight, or by supply unit (kg, etc.).<br>
          <br>
          Packaging materials only apply to product variations.
          Generally, this refers to the film or tray that products
          are packaged in. However, they can also be used for other
          materials, such as if special paper is inserted into product variations.
        production_zones: |
          <b>Production Zone Description</b>:<br>
          Production zones are used to create daily production charts
          based on inventory after orders are entered into the system
          and before they are shipped.<br>
          <br>
          All orders require a valid product variation within a valid product,
          and all product variations require a production zone.<br>
          <br>
          Production zones cannot be deleted if they have been used
          previously because product variations that used this production
          zone would no longer have an associated production zone.
          To disable a production zone, simply toggle the display switch.<br>
          <br>
          If you believe this is an exceptional situation,
          please contact your system administrator.
        products: |
          <b>Product Description</b>:<br>
          <br>
          All product variations require a main product, and all orders require a product variation.<br>
          <br>
          Think of products as base product settings, and product variations
          as sets with other related costs (shipping receptacles,
          shipping bands, ice, etc.).<br>
          <br>
          When using the production request and inventory system, the
          supply type is used to calculate the supplies needed for that request.
          There is a loss setting used to adjust that number.<br>
          <br>
          Product dimensions are used to estimate the amount of product
          that fits in a specified shipping receptacle. This can be
          changed on the product variation by manually adjusting the
          default items per shipping receptacle. If this value is left
          blank, the aforementioned estimate will be used as the default
          when this product is selected for an order.<br>
          <br>
          Cost estimates are calculated when orders are entered into
          the system based on the materials selected for individual products.
          Cost adjustments can also be manually changed for each order
          or order template.

        payment_receipt: |
          Orders can be registered as payment receipts by buyers for
          record-keeping and tax purposes. In quick entry mode,
          unpaid orders by buyer are displayed. Among these orders,
          you can select the period to apply payment credit.
          This data is also used in revenue analysis.
