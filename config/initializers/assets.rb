# Propshaft configuration
# Propshaft automatically serves all files from app/assets/{images,stylesheets,javascripts}
# and vendor/assets directories.

# If you need to exclude certain paths from being served, you can configure:
# Rails.application.config.assets.excluded_paths << Rails.root.join("app/assets/folder")

# NOTE: Bootstrap icons and JS are now managed via importmaps or directly served
# If bootstrap-icons are needed, copy them to app/assets/fonts or vendor/assets/fonts
