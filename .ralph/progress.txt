[2026-01-25 18:35:00] Story: US-001 Remove dual route files
Implemented: Removed dual route file pattern and adopted single engine route pattern
Files:
- config/routes_standalone_app.rb (deleted)
- config/routes_oroshi_engine.rb (deleted)
- config/routes.rb (updated comments)
- oroshi.gemspec (simplified, removed file exclusions)
Tests: PASSING (engine routes load correctly with 261 routes, model tests pass)
Learnings for future iterations:
- Oroshi uses single route file pattern: config/routes.rb with Oroshi::Engine.routes.draw
- Parent apps mount with: mount Oroshi::Engine, at: "/oroshi"
- sandbox script already generates its own routes.rb that mounts the engine
- gemspec no longer needs to exclude any config files
- Engine route helpers work without prefix inside engine, use oroshi.* prefix from parent
